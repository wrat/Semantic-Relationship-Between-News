Welcome to Topic modelling!
=================


About Problem:
	Use technique call Topic-modelling to find semantic relationship between news-article.there are two model for topic- modelling 
	1.)Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
	2.)Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
	
	Here I am using LSI model to find semantic relationship.First Train a lsi model from given corpus.then covert source document into
	lsi vector space.For finding semantic relationship We used similarity_matrix.

About Code:

	1.)topic_modelling.py file has fuction for topic-modelling models(LDA and LSI).Here We are using LSI model.So it will train lsi model from given news-corpus.

	2.) clean_doc.py file clean document like tokenization,remove stop-words,lemmatization.

	3.) tf-idf.py file build tf-idf for given document.

	4.) model.py prepare data for training and train and save model.

	5.) semantics.py find relationship between news-article as explained above.

	6.) util.py convert iterator into a list.
